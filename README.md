This repository contains the R code used to:
- Extract the features from all the datasets (and the function to extract the data given any time before the diagnosis of dementia) and prepare them as needed for the input in the ML models.
- The dementia ascertainment to assign the labels to the patients to train the models.
- The algorithm used to match the cases (patients living with dementia) with the controls randomly.
- Some code to describe the datsets.

*For more information, please check my document thesis - Chapter 5. 

It also contains all the codes in Python for the models trained. For more information, please check my document thesis - Chapter 7.
